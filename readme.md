# Project 2 in Life insurance I
This project is split into 2 parts.

The first part is to simulate and evaluate Kolmogorow forward on a life insurance transition graph, and apply Nelson-Aalen to evaluate and the method.

The second is about applying the Nelson-Aaleen on real data, and specifically multi-population data across multiple groups. Specifically we use nordic data.
